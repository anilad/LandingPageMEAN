    <h4>Ninja Facts:</h4>
    <p>According to ninja lore, though, the shinobi’s history stretched all the way back to the eight century. The Nihon Shoki, a pseudo-historical document riddled with mythology, claims that Prince Shook had a very skilled spymaster named Otomo-no-saibito.  The ninja manual Ninjutsu Ogiden claims he was so skilled that he and his organization of spies were given the title of “shinobi,” making him the ancestor of all ninja. Ninjutsu Ogiden was written in 1840, though, over a thousand years after Prince Shotoku walked the earth, so take that with a grain of salt.</p>
